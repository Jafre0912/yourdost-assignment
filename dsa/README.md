Note1: I have already solved a similar problem recently on GeeksforGeeks here:
-> https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/second-largest3735/1

Note2: if array is null or it's lenght is less then 2 then return -1;


Here's my Approach:
1)Created two variables â€” largest and secondLargest, both set to very small values(Long.MIN_VALUE).
then went through each element in the array:
2)If the number is greater than largest, update secondLargest = largest and made largest = number.
3)Else if the number is smaller than largest but greater than secondLargest, update secondLargest = number.
4)After checking all numbers, if secondLargest was never updated then return -1.


Complexity:
Time: O(N) because only one loop.
Space: O(1) because uses constant(no) extra space.
